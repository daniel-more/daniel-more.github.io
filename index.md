### Beyond the Stars: Smarter Restaurant Ratings With NLP & AI
This project enhances restaurant ratings by combining customer star scores with AI-driven insights extracted from written reviews, using a **BERT-based NLP model**. Rather than treating ratings as standard classification labels, the model applies the **CORAL ordinal regression framework** to capture the natural ranking between 1- to 5-star reviews—producing **more consistent, stable, and accurate rating predictions than traditional classification methods that ignore rating order** and often misinterpret close-range scores (e.g., confusing a 4-star rating with a 1-star rating equally as with a 5-star one).
